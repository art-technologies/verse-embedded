# Key concepts


### Edition

An edition is an NFT. 


### Artwork

An artwork is a container for editions and can host a primary market sale.


### Series

Series (also known as collections) contain one or more artworks.

If a series contains an artwork with an active or upcoming primary market sale, the primary market sale is displayed at the top of the page.

If a series contains more than one artwork with active and/or upcoming primary market sales, then a grid of artworks is displayed at the top of the page.

If any child artworks contain any editions, a grid of editions is displayed beneath any active/upcoming primary market sales. 

We recommend embedding series instead of artworks wherever possible. 


### Primary market sale

A primary market (PM) sale is a sale from which collectors can purchase editions from the artist and/or gallery.

PM sales are configured for artworks. 

When a collector make a purchase from a PM sale, they receive an edition.
